# Tech Stack

Coaxist is a **single Docker container** containing:

- [**Plex**](https://plex.tv): Excellent server for self-hosting media. Plex has
  high-quality native apps for TV boxes, mobile devices, and desktop.
- [**Overseerr**](https://overseerr.dev): Request management software for Plex
  which doubles as an excellent server for media metadata.
- [**Rclone**](https://rclone.org/): Mounts WebDAV directories locally so that
  Plex can stream media files without copying them to local storage.
- [**Connector**](connector/README.md): Watches for media requests from
  Overseerr, searches for media sources using Torrentio, and sends selected
  torrents to a Debrid service for download.

Coaxist uses the following public cloud services:

- [**Torrentio**](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure): Searches for media
  sources on torrent sites and converts magnet links to Debrid request links.
- **Debrid**: A paid service which downloads torrents and serves their contents.

# FAQ

## I'm having trouble running Coaxist. Can you help me?

Please try the following first and see if you notice anything:

- Review the [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) guide from top to bottom.
- Look for relevant messages in the container logs.
- Run the Coaxist container with the `LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable set
  (Docker flag: `-e LOG_LEVEL=debug`) and look for relevant messages at the
  debug level.

If you're still having trouble, I can provide limited support via GitHub Issues.

do my best to help.

## How long does it take for media that I request to appear in Plex?

Connector scans for new requests every 15 seconds by default. When it finds a
new request, it immediately starts searching for content.

The Debrid service can vary – if the content is cached, it might appear in your
user directory in seconds, but uncached content must be downloaded from the
torrent swarm.

I recommend setting your Plex server to scan its library as frequently as
possible to ensure it finds your new Debrid content quickly. See the
[Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md#enable-periodic-scan) guide.

## What is a Debrid service?

A Debrid service is a paid commercial subscription service that works in a way
similar to a hosted seedbox. This service takes a torrent file, magnet link, or
link to a file hosting service such as Mediafire. It downloads the content to
its own servers, then makes the content available to the subscriber.

Many providers support "instant" downloads, where content you request is
immediately copied into your storage if another subscriber has requested it in
the past. In Coaxist, we tag these results as `cached`, and you can prefer these
results in your [Media Profile](docs/profiles.md#tags).

## Where does the media come from?

Coaxist uses [Torrentio](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper) to
search
[public torrent trackers](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper/blob/d89ff904758d71172a406e73efe7acbef41f4860/addon/lib/magnetHelper.js)
for requested media.

## What am I connecting to exactly?

Coaxist uses a Debrid service to access all media. When downloading through a
Debrid service, the Debrid service is connecting to the P2P torrent swarm and
downloading files on your behalf. You connect directly to the Debrid service to
access this content.

## What does my ISP see?

Your ISP may be able to see that you are searching public torrent trackers or
connecting to the Debrid service.

## Is this legal and safe to use?

This software is provided as-is. I make no guarantees or warranties about
